I looked around and the rain that had persisted throughout the day was still going strong covering the trees around me in a thick fog. There was no one else at the bus stop. “How odd” i thought “normally it's swarming with people, the 5 O'clock Bus must have already come and gone. I sat there for a few moments listening to the gentle pitter patter of the rain falling on the asphalt. Until i heard it. An ear piercing scream cut through the rain, help me called the voice. I stood up and looked around but there was no one in sight. Over her please help me. I turned around and could barely make out 2 figures in the fog one looked to be struggling against the other one's grasp. I grabbed my yellow rain poncho and started running towards the shapes in the fog. Hey let go of them I shouted. The taller of the figures the one gripping the other stated to run dragging the second figure clumsily behind them. Help help me please. Dont worry im coming i cried out. We ran down a dirt path, slick with mud from the rain. Until we reached a tall iron clad fence with a grand looking gate. I couldn't remember if i had seen this place before, it didn't look familiar but there was no time to think about it. The figures ran through the gate into the yard beyond. I followed suit and realized I was in a graveyard. Suddenly I heard a loud clang behind me. I spun around to see that the gates slammed shut. I looked back and saw that the fog was clearing to reveal a massive graveyard nothing but tombstones for as far as the eye could see. But there was no trace of the figures. Where could they have gone, what's happening? I was so confused. The rain pounded harder around me drowning out my footsteps. Then I heard something new, a low gravelly voice right in my ear. “Welcome to the grave yard alex she is waiting for you”. Who's there I shouted I spun in a circle but there was no one there.

I watched in horror as the statue came to life a little girl came floating out of the stone she had tears streaming down her face and a teddy bear in one of her translucent hands. Her hair was done up in pigtails the trained down to her once white shirt that was now dyed red with blood. She floated toward me wailing. It's not fair it's not fair she said why does he still get to live well i have died. She continued crying. I had no clue what to do i stood frozen unable to get my thoughts straight. She turned to me her ice blue eyes cutting into my soul. I know she said trough sobs. You can help me. I need you to kill the gravedigger he lives in a house behind the tree on the other side of the grave yard. She handed me a knife. I was shocked this girl wanted me to take another life. Why why would i do that i stammered. Because if you do i'll give you my teddy bear so do we have a deal." << endl;

Eight spindly legs crept along my arm one after another inching closer and closer to my face. I screamed and tried to fling it off but to no avail. It clung on piercing through my rubber rain coat. I crept closer and closer its legs crept up my neck. I grabbed at it and managed to pull it off. It failed trying to escape clashing its fangs together. I trough it to the floor and crushed it under my heel. Once i was satisfied it was dead i perired back into the semily empty jar.

They continued to sing each line was traded off. First the high clear voice and then the low gravely one. Each getting louder and closer. Oh mother let's go down let's go down come on down.

I walked over to the door and started to yank on the handle but it didn't budge and the music got louder. It started to drown out my thoughts i could barely hear myself think. I grabbed my head covering my ears trying to drain out the song but i couldn't. All i heard was the melody getting louder and louder. My head was pounding i felt something thick and sticky started pouring from my ears. I started to ram myself against the door i have to get out i have to get away.
